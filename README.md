# Start IT Java group test 1

### Welcome, young grasshopper!

Today you will create your own start-up business. *(Wait, wasn't this about programming or something?)*

My name is Tom and I will be your personal assistant on this journey.
Like any good story, yours will also require a lot of logical thinking and problem solving skills. Your tools for the job are your brain and the Java programming language. As you encounter problems, think about them in an abstract manner, break them down into steps and sub-problems, and apply the toolset you have acquired over the last 1.5 weeks.

Godspeed!
